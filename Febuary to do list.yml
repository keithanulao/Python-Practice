Notes / Reflection:
- Overall improvement on coding
- Even if I am taking care of children, I think that I can pick up the pace
- One thing that I'd like to do is hone in on the field that I desire to work in 
- Ideally this field will already be working in python, however, if I must learn a new language I will

To do list:
- Begin exercising again
    - Fix pull up bar
    - Setup dumbell press
    - Hiking has been going great for the leg workout 

- Create Minecraft world that replicates house:
    - this will help with planning the crops and potential shed placement
    
- Learn how to grow plants and vegtables:
    - Research on which crops grow insanely easy in the southern Virginia area
    - Create a compost pile
    - Cultivate and prepare the soil
    - Plant the seeds
